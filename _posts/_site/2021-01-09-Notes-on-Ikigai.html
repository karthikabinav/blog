<p>I recently listened to this audio book “Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life” by Hector Garcia and Francesc Miralles. This book studies the people who live in the northern part of Japan who are known to have long life-spans. Summarizing the learnings, these are the ten rules to find Ikigai.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Stay active and don’t retire: Essentially find something to do that energizes the mind and body. Continue to do this that brings joy, provides value to others  even after the official professional activity has ended.</li>
  <li>Take it slow: Always being in a constant rush decreases the quality of life. The quote from this book is “Walk slowly and you will go far”.</li>
  <li>Don’t fill your stomach fully: Essentially eat meals and stop when you are roughly about 80% full. Stick to controlled calorific inputs and try to fast at least once a week to reset the digestive system.</li>
  <li>Surround yourself with good friends: They are good source for sharing good stories, getting advice and having fun.</li>
  <li>Get in shape: The recommendation is to have moderate activity everyday to keep the physical body in shape. This could include taking walks, going on bike rides etc. Also have exercise where the arm is lifted above the level of the ear.</li>
  <li>Smile: This refers to always smiling at people, hardships and any situation that life throws at us. A cheerful attitude will attract good friends (#4).</li>
  <li>Reconnect with nature: Living in large cities, we lose touch with nature. Try to go to places such as the woods, trails etc to interact with nature.</li>
  <li>Give thanks: Giving gratitude to people, ancestors, to the nature and the food we eat. This helps us maintain a more cheerful attitude (#6).</li>
  <li>Live in the moment: Do not be overly worried about the future or brood over the past. As an example, a surfer’s attention is always at the wave he is riding and that point does not worry about anything else.</li>
  <li>Follow your ikigai: There is a passion inside you and follow that till the very end. If you haven’t found it yet, your mission is to find the ikigai and then follow it.</li>
</ol>
