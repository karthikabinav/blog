In this post we will summarize the main contents in the book on science on Pleasure.

## Preface

This book is about the science of why humans like pleasure. Does it come from evolutionary principles? What about various things like art, sex, food, pornography, etc.

# Chapter 1

This chapter deals with the pleasure of food. It starts out with a story of consensual cannibalism, where a computer expert finds the best person and after consensual agreement, eats him slowly. He was later convicted of manslaughter and murder. The author is curious how the liking for food as a pleasure is linked with this story, which he goes on to explain in this chapter.
