In this post we will summarize the main contents in the book on science on Pleasure.

## Preface

This book is about the science of why humans like pleasure. Does it come from evolutionary principles? What about various things like art, sex, food, pornography, etc.

# Chapter 1

This chapter deals with the pleasure of food. It starts out with a story of consensual cannibalism, where a computer expert finds the best person and after consensual agreement, eats him slowly. He was later convicted of manslaughter and murder. The author is curious how the liking for food as a pleasure is linked with this story, which he goes on to explain in this chapter. The claim is that people's likes and dislikes is mostly a construct of the society. One of the emotions is disgust. Consider trying a new food. Suppose immediately after eating the food you fell ill. Then you are most likely to be disgusted/avoid this food in future. In particular, humans are conditioned to develop a disgust towards any meat that is not consumed. *E.g.,* Insects for societies that don't eat meat, Chicken, Beef for vegetarians in India, etc.
